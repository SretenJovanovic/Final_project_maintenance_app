            Web application for reporting equipement failures
        </h2>
        <p>A ticketing application is a software program used to manage and track tickets or requests
            submitted by
            customers or
            users for a particular service or product.
        </p>
        <p>
            This type of application is commonly used in industries such as IT,
            customer support, and event management, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application typically allows users to submit a ticket or request through a web interface or mobile app,
            which is
            then assigned to an appropriate team or individual for resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application may also have features such as
            automated ticket routing, prioritization, and escalation based on predefined rules and policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ticketing applications typically provide a centralized dashboard for managing tickets, enabling users to view,
            update, and close tickets as needed. They may also offer reporting and analytics features to track ticket
            volumes,
            response times, and other metrics.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to customer-facing ticketing applications, some organizations also use internal ticketing
            applications
            to manage requests from employees or departments within the company.
        </p>
        <p>These applications may include additional
            features such as knowledge bases, chat or messaging functionality, and collaboration tools to facilitate
            communication and issue resolution within the organization.
